My major scientific interests are to improve or develop epidemiologic methods related to risk prediction, mixture analysis, repeated measures, multivariate analysis, causal mediation analysis, causal inference, and applying machine learning approaches in epidemiologic research. I apply these techniques in neuroepidemiology (e.g., early childhood development, neurodevelopment, and disorders), environmental epidemiology, reproductive health, non-communicable diseases, and social epidemiology.
# Area(s) of Specialization
Epidemiologic Methods, machine learning and causal inference, Chemical Mixture Analysis, computational epidemiology, perinatal epidemiology, reproductive health and chronic diseases
