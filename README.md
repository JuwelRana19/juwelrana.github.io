My major scientific interests are to develop or improve epidemiological methods related to risk prediction, mixture analysis, repeated measures, multivariate analysis, causal mediation analysis, causal inference and applying machine learning approaches in epidemiology. I apply these techniques in perinatal epidemiology (early childhood development, developmental delays, and disorders, child mortality), reproductive health, non-communicable diseases, and environmental epidemiology.
