My major scientific interests are to improve or develop epidemiologic methods related to risk prediction, mixture analysis, repeated measures, multivariate analysis, causal mediation analysis, causal inference, and applying machine learning approaches in epidemiologic research. I apply these techniques in neuroepidemiology (e.g., early childhood development, neurodevelopment, and disorders), environmental epidemiology, reproductive health, non-communicable diseases, and social epidemiology.
